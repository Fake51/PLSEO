Introduction
============
This is a set of stand-alone SEO tools, meant to be run on their own and the
output captured and used in some fashion.

Usage
=====
The tools are supposed to be run using the .sh files. If you're on Windows
or Mac have a look inside those files, there should be info enough for you to
be able to create a .bat or the likes. Also, all .sh files should output some
help text if you just run the without any parameters.
