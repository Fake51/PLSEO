Introduction
============
This is a set of stand-alone SEO tools, meant to be run on their own and the
output captured and used in some fashion.

Usage
=====
The tools can be run on their own or as a library. To run them on their own
have a look at the .sh file in the repo - it should give you ideas on how
to get it running and how to create similar .bat scripts for windows.

To run it as a library, you just need to include the searchclient.php file,
instantiate a SearchClient object, and set a few settings on that - then you
can call findRankings() and getSiteRankings() on the object and you should
get the data output from the search.

Output
======
The output of findRankings() is a multi-dimension array, the layout of which
differs depending upon your settings. If you're just requesting rankings for
one keyword, your output should look like (multiple sites makes no difference
to the output as it returns search engine hits by keyword):
array(
 'engine' => array(
  page_number => array(
   hit_number => array(
    'url'      => hit url,
    'headline' => headline of search hit
   )
  )
 )
)

If you're querying multiple keywords, output is wrapped in an array, like:
array(
 keyword => array(
  'engine' => array(
   page_number => array(
    hit_number => array(
     'url'      => hit url,
     'headline' => headline of search hit
    )
   )
  )
 )
)

The output of getSiteRankings() will display how the domains you queried
rank in the search findings. The output looks like (for single keywords):
array(
 domain => array(
  engine => rank
 )
)

If you're querying for multiple keywords, the above is wrapped in an array,
like this:
array(
 keyword => array(
  domain => array(
   engine => rank
  )
 )
)

A ranking of null means "not found" in the returned pages.
